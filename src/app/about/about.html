				<p> <strong>But why?</strong> As a business analyst for a MNC I spent a considerable amount of time fighting with big messy excel files. I discovered that I had a knack for automating repetitive tasks with VBA (the excel coding language) and simplyfying the big messy excel files. This awoke my enthusiasm for programming. Subsequently I found web-development and JavaScript, and I started to immerse myself in programming morning, evening and weekends.

				<strong>What else?</strong> I am born and raised in a self-governed tiny island (population: 28k) between Finland and Sweden called The Ã…land Islands. I can speak 4 (human) languages. I have an MA in finance. I have lived (worked/studied) in Finland, Korea and Malaysia.  </p>
